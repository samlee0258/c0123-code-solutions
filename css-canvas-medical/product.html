          You don&apos;t have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or bounce around five
          windows to discover the last blood count. Canvas pulls everything you need directly into
          your note&comma; so you never have to leave it. And because Canvas learns from every
          interaction&comma; it gets smarter with every patient you see.

            Canvas works three times as fast&comma; improves preformance dramatically on key
            quality metrics&comma; and is incredibly easy to use. The right information is
            presented in the right way at the right time&comma; and the product leverages
            technology to actually improve the quality of care I provide.

          Canvas makes it simple to search and take action across your entire patient panel&comma;
          so you know who needs extra help and how best to give it to them. Easily reach out to
          any subgroup of your population with proactive interventions&comma; and take comfort
          knowing you&apos;re a step ahead.

            Which of my uncontrolled diabetic patients haven&apos;t had a test in the past 3
            months? Which of my patients are on potentially unsafe levels of opioids according
            to the most recent guidelines? That doesn&apos;t seem like a lot to ask and those are
            tremendously important questions. But I just couldn&apos;t get an answer from our
            old system! Canvas is light&hyphen;years ahead.

        <h2>It automates performance improvement</h2>
        <p>
          Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand preformance, but
          they aren&apos;t enough to improve quality and increase revenue day after day. Canvas
          automates quality protocals and charge capture so clinicians can focus on more complex
          work only they can do.

            With MIPS a reality and fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service billing rules as complex as
            ever&comma; to be honest I didn&apos;t know how we were going to keep up. We&apos;re a
            small practice and we don&apos;t have a big quality team or a group of coders to catch
            everything. The automation in Canvas has completely eliminated my concerns around quality
            and revenure preformance.
